# Dota 2 Analysis

### By: Chip Hennig, Kyle Rodrigues, Joe Weller

This analysis of the [Dota 2 matches dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/dota-2-matches) is the final project submission for MSOE's CS 4980, Data warehousing and Mining course.

The dataset consists of 50,000 Dota 2 matches. Note that we only used the following csvs from the dataset: hero_names, item_ids, match, player_time, and players. 

This project will be broken into multiple parts which will comprehensivly simulate the data science process. 
These parts include creating hypotheses, data importing/combining, data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning modeling. 

The hypotheses being tested are the following:

1. The number of times players chose items and heroes follow a normal distribution over the course of multiple games.
2. A team’s hero and item composition can produce optimal trends for total team effectiveness.
3. It’s possible to reliably engineer an MVP feature for the player which contributed the most.
4. The MVP score calculation can correlate with the player’s chance of winning.

Our output we created is an html document that can be downloaded and opened to view the report (similiar to reading a webpage article).
